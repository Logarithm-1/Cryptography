**Deciphering:** The act or operation of **decrypting** a **cipher message**.

**Decipherment:** The **deciphered** version of the **ciphertext**, as well as the act or proccess itself.

**Decrypt:** To reconvert or transform a **cryptogram** into the origial equivalent **plaintext message** by a direct reversal of the **encrypting** process.

**Elementry Sounds:** **Letter's** are convential symbols representing sounds.

**Encoded Cipher:** A rare, but possible, case where the final **cryptogram** is produced by **enciphering** the **plaintext** and then **encoding** the **ciphertext** obtained from the first operation.

**Encodement:** The **encoded** version of the **plaintext**, as well as the act or process itself.

**Encoding:** The act or operation of **encrypting** a **code message.**

**Enciphered-code Message:** The **encipherment** of the characters comprisiing the **codetext**. Also know as **enciphered code**.

**Enciphering:** The act or operation of **encrypting** a **cipher message**.

**Encipherment:** The **enciphered** version of the **plaintext**, as well as the act or proccess itself.

**Encrypt:** To convert or transform a **plaintext message** into a **cryptogram** by following certain rules, steps, or processes consitution the **key** or **keys** and agreed upon in advance.

**Encrypted Text:** Visible writing which conveys no intelliglible meaning in any recongnized language.

**General System:** The totality of these basic, invariable rules, processes, or steops to be followed in **encrypting** a message according to the agreed method constitutes the general **cryptographic system** or more briefly, the **general system.**

**Invariant:** Constant or unvarying in their use in a given set of communications.

**Key:** The element which specifically governs the manner in which the **general system** will be applied in a specific message, or the exact **setting** of a **cipher device** or a **cipher machine** at the inital point of **encipherment** or **decipherment** of a specif message. Typically a number, letter, a group of letters, a word, a phrase, or sentence.

**Letters:** 26 simple charaters of the English alphabet. Can also consist of other charaters of other alphabets.

**Mixed Cipher Alphabets:** The equence of letters or characters in one or both of both the components is no longer the same as the normal in its entirety. 

**Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipehrs:** A **Substitution cipher** in which for a given **key**, the **cipher alphabet** for each **plain alphabet** is fixed throughout the **encryption** proscess, of which only one **cipher alphabet** is involved. For example, if 'A' is encrypted as 'D', for any occurance in that **plaintext**, 'A' will always get **encrypted** to 'D'.
